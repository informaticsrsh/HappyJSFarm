# Happy JS Farm

A simple farming simulation game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## How to Run

This project uses modern JavaScript modules, which require it to be run from a web server to function correctly due to browser security policies.

A Python script is included to make this easy.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3 must be installed on your system.

### Instructions

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the root directory of this project.
3.  Run the server script:
    ```sh
    python serve.py
    ```
4.  The script will automatically open the game in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.
5.  To stop the server, go back to your terminal and press `Ctrl+C`.

Enjoy the game!
